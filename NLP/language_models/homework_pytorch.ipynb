They have been the target of various recent experiments, with\\nhealthy participants and psychiatric populations engaging as dyads in\\nmulti-round exchanges such as a repeated trust task. Behaviour in such\\nexchanges involves complexities related to each agent's preference for equity\\nwith their partner, beliefs about the partner's appetite for equity, beliefs\\nabout the partner's model of their partner, and so on. Agents may also plan\\ndifferent numbers of steps into the future. Providing a computationally precise\\naccount of the behaviour is an essential step towards understanding what\\nunderlies choices. A natural framework for this is that of an interactive\\npartially observable Markov decision process (IPOMDP). However, the various\\ncomplexities make IPOMDPs inordinately computationally challenging. Here, we\\nshow how to approximate the solution for the multi-round trust task using a\\nvariant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. We demonstrate that the\\nalgorithm is efficient and effective, and therefore can be used to invert\\nobservations of behavioural choices. We use generated behaviour to elucidate\\nthe richness and sophistication of interactive inference.\",\n          \"CNNs have massively improved performance in object detection in photographs.\\nHowever research into object detection in artwork remains limited. We show\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a challenging dataset, People-Art, which\\ncontains people from photos, cartoons and 41 different artwork movements. We\\nachieve this high performance by fine-tuning a CNN for this task, thus also\\ndemonstrating that training CNNs on photos results in overfitting for photos:\\nonly the first three or four layers transfer from photos to artwork. Although\\nthe CNN's performance is the highest yet, it remains less than 60\\\\% AP,\\nsuggesting further work is needed for the cross-depiction problem.

The algorithm handles the supply networks\\nwhere capacity investments and product flows are variables. The networks are\\nconstrained by a need to satisfy product demands. Two features of the slime\\nmould are adopted in our algorithm. The first is the continuity of a flux\\nduring the iterative process, which is used in real-time update of the costs\\nassociated with the supply links. The second feature is adaptivity. The supply\\nchain can converge to an equilibrium state when costs are changed.
